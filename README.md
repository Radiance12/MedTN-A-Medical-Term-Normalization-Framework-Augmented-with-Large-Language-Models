# MedTN-A-Medical-Term-Normalization-Framework-Augmented-with-Large-Language-Models

We constructed a Chinese Medical Terms dataset (CMT) based on the QiZhen Medical Knowledge Base. The data source of the QiZhen Medical Knowledge Base includes diagnosis and treatment experience of clinical guidelines, medical standards, references, medical textbooks and so on. The data are collected and then some algorithms are employed such as Sentence-BERT\cite{reimers-gurevych-2019-sentence}, TextRank, KeyBERT and so on to extract the corresponding terms and synonyms. Morever, to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the data, multiple rounds of analysis, verification and checks were performed by medical experts. The dataset mainly contains medical terms with similar word forms but different semantics or different word forms but the same semantics. In addition, we also constructed CSKB dataset based on Chinese Symptom Knowledge Base (CSKB).
